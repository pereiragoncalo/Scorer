# Build log

## Packaging snapshot, 23/10/2026
- Google Drive v006 used as baseline.
- Verified local `python3 -m py_compile` succeeds.
- Android SDK/NDK and APK/AAB compilation: **not executed or verified**.
- Hardware smoke tests: **not executed**.

## Next run
Codex should append the exact commands, logs, test results and blockers for each task.

## 2026-10-23 — phase 1, source candidate 0.6.1

Read AGENTS.md, README.md, ROADMAP.md and FIRST_CODEX_TASK.md before edits.
Validated archive paths and baseline/main SHA256 against SOURCE_CHECKSUM.txt.
Imported starter in commit 957f7c5; retained Scorer history and a recoverable
Git bundle outside the checkout at /workspace/scorer-before-striker.bundle.

Changes: moved original simulation/career definitions into a headless career.py;
main.py keeps the original Kivy UI and imports its required core symbols. Added
private Android saves, legacy migration, atomic writes with visible error,
generic default Alex Silva, 13 regression/security tests, pinned host dependencies,
workspace Buildozer cache helper and candidate API 36/arm64/NDK28c settings.
No baseline changes; existing saved names remain unchanged.

Commands/results:
- `python3 -m py_compile main.py career.py tools/build_android.py`: PASS.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 13 tests PASS, none skipped.
  Covers imports without Kivy, career training/match progress, restart, v1/v2
  saves, invalid JSON, unknown migration versions, no-overwrite migration,
  write failure preserving previous save, private Android path via simulated App,
  FREE boundary, provider failure and save tampering unable to unlock WORLD.
- Installed Buildozer 1.5.0, Kivy 2.3.1, Cython 0.29.37 in external venv.
- `buildozer -v android debug`: FAILED on missing distutils with Python 3.12.
  Installed setuptools 75.8.2, retried: FAILED on read-only ~/.buildozer.
- `python tools/build_android.py -v android debug`: cache corrected; FAILED
  prerequisite check: Java compiler (javac) not found. Retried after spec update,
  same confirmed prerequisite. No native compilation or APK/AAB generated.
- `apt-cache policy ...`: system metadata has no candidates for checked build
  packages; system locations are read-only. Full build image still required.
- Kivy desktop smoke: initial KIVY_HOME parent missing, created parent and retried.
  App opened with SDL2/Mesa llvmpipe, ran event loop and stopped via Clock after
  two seconds, exit 0 and UI_STARTUP_OK. Not an Android/touchscreen test.
- `pyflakes main.py career.py tests tools`: initial unused imports cleaned.
  Remaining diagnostic is original UI local variable `score` assigned but unused;
  no undefined-name diagnostics. Full lint is therefore not a clean pass.
- Read-only upstream p4a clone at pinned commit: NDK recommendation 28c, AGP
  8.11.0, Python recipe 3.14.2, Kivy 2.3.1. Compatibility and 16 KB compliance
  remain UNVERIFIED until native build/output/device tests.

Security audit: no payments enabled; FREE remains fail closed. Baseline excluded
from APK sources to avoid shipping its personal default name. Original optional
Wikipedia badge fetch/image URLs and generated sound/cache paths require follow-up
review. Static reference manifest does not prove actual package policy. No secret
or signing key created. This is not a complete security certification.

Next task: provide full Android build prerequisites, generate debug APK, verify
manifest/ELF alignment and install on real Android hardware before ad-board work.
